              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                  Expiry is a hint as to when the issued token will exipre.
                  The access token itself is the source of truth, provided the private key is
                  still around, so this is a fallback, as well as a cache to improve API read
                  performance by avoiding the decryption.
