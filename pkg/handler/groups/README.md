# `pkg/handler/groups`

This package manages the primary local delegation unit inside an organization.

## Intent

Groups are the main attachment point between identities and authority.

They answer three related questions:

- which users are members of the group
- which service accounts are members of the group
- which roles those members inherit through the group

Projects then refer to groups rather than directly to users or roles, so this package sits at the
center of organization-local delegation.

## What Is Specific Here

### Primary Binding Layer For Local Authority

This client is where organization membership turns into inherited permissions.

Users and service accounts do not receive roles directly through this handler layer. Instead, they
become members of groups, and groups carry the `RoleIDs` that define the granted authority.

That makes groups the main local delegation unit for both human and non-human actors.

### Compatibility Bridge Between `UserIDs` And `Subjects`

The package still supports both:

- legacy `UserIDs`, which refer to `OrganizationUser` records
- newer `Subjects`, which can refer to local or external identities

When a request uses one of those representations, the client populates the other where possible so
old and new clients can coexist during the migration period.

This compatibility behaviour is one of the main reasons the package is more than simple CRUD.

### Role Assignment Guard Rails

Group role assignment is where the handler layer turns the deeper RBAC security model into a
concrete write-time check.

When roles are attached to a group, this client:

- verifies the role exists
- rejects protected roles, whether newly added or already on the group
- rejects newly added roles the caller is not permitted to grant in that organization
- rejects updates that drop a role the caller is not permitted to grant in that organization

The grant check on addition applies only to the delta: roles already on the group before the write
are not re-checked, so a caller can edit membership on a group that carries a role they could not
grant themselves, and can resend that group's existing role list without the write being refused. A
role being added is always grant-checked, on both create and update; create has no prior state, so
every role in the request counts as an addition. A refused grant names the role so the caller knows
which one to remove or delegate.

Removal is guarded symmetrically, on update only: dropping a role from the group's current
`RoleIDs` that is not present in the request is refused unless the caller could grant that role
themselves. Without this, a client that cannot resolve an ungrantable role — for example one that
only fetches the roles it is permitted to see and then round-trips the group as it received it —
would silently revoke that role by omitting it from the write, rather than the write being refused.
A role reference that no longer resolves to a `Role` resource may always be dropped, since a
dangling reference conveys no permissions to revoke. A refused removal names the role so the caller
knows which one it cannot drop.

So group writes are also authority-delegation checks, for both grants and revocations.

### Project Reference Cleanup

Projects use groups as access boundaries.

Because of that, deleting a group is not a local-only operation. The client must first remove the
group from any project `groupIDs` that still reference it, otherwise project-scoped access state
would drift.

## Invariants

- groups are the primary organization-local attachment point between members and roles
- `RoleIDs` are the actual delegated-authority payload of the group
- protected roles must never be attached to a group
- callers may only add roles they are allowed to grant in that organization; roles already on the
  group are not re-checked on subsequent writes
- callers may only drop roles from a group on update if they are allowed to grant that role, unless
  the role no longer exists
- internal compatibility between `UserIDs` and `Subjects` should be maintained where possible
- group membership and role/service-account ID lists are normalized to first-occurrence unique values
- projects should not retain references to groups that no longer exist

## Caveats

- The package is partly a migration bridge because it must support both deprecated `UserIDs` and
  forward-looking `Subjects`.
- Groups may include external subjects that do not resolve to local `User` objects, so not every
  group member is necessarily backed by a local user record.
- Referential integrity across groups, users, service accounts, and projects is best-effort on top
  of Kubernetes storage rather than atomically enforced by the backing store.
